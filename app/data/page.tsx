      <header className="page-intro"><p className="eyebrow">Data and sourcing</p><h1>Every guide shows<br />what supports it.</h1><p>The same generated pathway catalog powers browsing, guidance matching, permanent guide pages, and the knowledge graph.</p></header>

      <section><h2>Two guide levels</h2><p>{journeys.length} reviewed guides contain ordered steps checked against official sources. {discoveredGuides.length} discovered guides expose official outcomes and destinations immediately while their detailed instructions await review.</p></section>
      <section><h2>Autonomous expansion</h2><p>Twice-monthly jobs advance through federal and state site inventories, preserve earlier discoveries, rank action-oriented pages, generate guide records and graph links, build the site, and publish the new snapshot when every gate passes.</p></section>
      <section><h2>Search-quality gate</h2><p>Every discovered path is browsable. Thin or administrative pages remain out of the XML sitemap and carry a no-index directive until the crawler has enough useful title and summary detail for a worthwhile search result.</p></section>
      <section><h2>Coverage is measurable</h2><p>Government changes too quickly for a truthful claim of permanent completeness. govroute exposes current counts and statuses while the scheduled crawler steadily expands coverage within each site’s robots rules and rate limits.</p></section>
      <section><h2>Place and jurisdiction coverage</h2><p>{registry.status === "available" ? `${registry.placeCount.toLocaleString()} geographic records and ${registry.sourceCount.toLocaleString()} explicitly scoped procedure or legal sources are published in the location registry.` : "The national place registry has not been published in this application yet. Federal and existing state pathways remain available."} Place coverage and pathway coverage are separate. A named community may have no government of its own, and a geographic parent is not automatically the authority for every task.</p></section>
      <section><h2>Official and informal names</h2><p>Locations draw on <a href="https://tigerweb.geo.census.gov/arcgis/rest/services/TIGERweb/tigerWMS_Current/MapServer">Census legal and statistical areas</a> and <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/us-board-on-geographic-names/download-gnis-data">USGS geographic names</a>. Non-official variants remain labeled unofficial. Census functional status distinguishes functioning governments from statistical or inactive entities.</p></section>
      <section><h2>Property-specific questions</h2><p>Address lookup uses Census address ranges, which do not verify a home’s parcel boundary. Land-use and rights pathways need local parcel records, zoning and overlays, applicable law, and recorded deeds or restrictions. Missing sources remain visible.</p></section>
